# 🔍 ML-Stat-House-Price-Predictor

**A comparative analysis of machine learning and statistical models to predict house prices across Boston and California datasets.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

Accurate house price prediction guides investment strategy, city planning, and public policy. This project explores how traditional statistical approaches perform compared to modern machine learning techniques—uncovering which model delivers higher accuracy and better generalizability across diverse datasets.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 📈 Achieved **90%+ R²** on the Boston dataset with tuned **XGBoost**, reducing RMSE by **40%** compared to linear baselines  
- 🧪 Built a complete pipeline: **data cleaning → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → visualization**  
- 🛠️ Benchmarked five models: `Linear`, `Ridge`, `KNN`, `Random Forest`, and `XGBoost`—with and without hyperparameter tuning

## 🗃️ Data Overview

- **California Housing**: 20,640 rows · 10 features  
- **Boston Housing**: 506 rows · 13 features  
- 🔍 Features include: geographic coordinates, median income, total rooms, proximity to ocean, etc.
